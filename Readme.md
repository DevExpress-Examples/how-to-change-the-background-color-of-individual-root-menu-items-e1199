# How to change the background color of individual root menu items


<p>This example demonstrates how to define different background colors for root menu items. </p><p>To do this, we use root items <strong>TextTemplate</strong> and place a new table (with a defined background color) inside it. The <strong>ASPxLabel's</strong> Text property is data bound to the menu item's Text property. Note that the control's paddings and spacings should be set to "0".</p>
